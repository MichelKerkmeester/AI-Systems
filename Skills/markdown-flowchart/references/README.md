# Markdown Flowchart Reference Examples

This directory contains beautifully crafted flowchart examples demonstrating different patterns and use cases for the markdown-flowchart skill.

## Files

### 1. **simple-workflow.md** - Linear Sequential Flow
Basic linear workflow demonstrating sequential steps without branching.
- **Use Case**: User registration process
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Pattern**: Pattern 1 (Linear Sequential)
- **Best For**: Onboarding flows, setup wizards, simple form submissions

### 2. **parallel-execution.md** - Concurrent Tasks with Synchronization
Demonstrates multiple tasks running simultaneously with synchronization points.
- **Use Case**: CI/CD deployment pipeline with parallel tests
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Pattern**: Pattern 3 (Parallel Execution)
- **Best For**: Testing workflows, deployment pipelines, concurrent processing

### 3. **user-onboarding.md** - Multi-Step Journey with Celebrations
Complete user onboarding journey with embedded multi-step processes.
- **Use Case**: Barter app enhanced onboarding
- **Complexity**: High
- **Pattern**: Pattern 4 (Nested Sub-Process)
- **Best For**: Product onboarding, progressive feature introduction, layered flows

### 4. **decision-tree-flow.md** - Complex Decision Logic
Complex decision tree with multiple branches and conditional logic.
- **Use Case**: E-commerce order processing system
- **Complexity**: High
- **Pattern**: Pattern 2 (Decision Branch) with nesting
- **Best For**: Order processing, multi-criteria evaluation, conditional routing

### 5. **approval-workflow-loops.md** - Review Cycles with Loops
Document approval flow with multiple reviewers, revision cycles, and escalation.
- **Use Case**: Marketing content approval process
- **Complexity**: High
- **Pattern**: Pattern 6 (Loop/Iteration) + Pattern 5 (Approval Gate)
- **Best For**: Content review, document approval, quality assurance, change management

### 6. **system-architecture-swimlane.md** - Multi-Layer Architecture
Multi-tier system architecture showing interaction between different layers.
- **Use Case**: Microservices authentication and data flow
- **Complexity**: High
- **Pattern**: Advanced (Swimlane Diagram)
- **Best For**: System architecture, API flows, microservices, data pipelines
