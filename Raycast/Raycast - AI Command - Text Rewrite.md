### **Even More Minimal Version** (if you prefer ultra-simple):
```
Rewrite {selection}. Scale variations by length: 1-30 words = 9 versions, 31-150 = 6 versions, 151+ = 3 versions.

Organize into three equal groups:

**MOST CONCISE**: Shortest possible versions

**MOST VALUABLE**: Strongest messaging versions  

**MOST AUTHENTIC**: Different angle versions

Preserve all facts, numbers, dates, links, and {variables}. Maintain original tone. No labels or commentary in output.
