# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# PARALLEL EXECUTION ARCHITECTURE
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
parallel_execution:
  overview: |
    To prevent token limit exhaustion, the workflow is decomposed into 3 parallel stages.
    Each stage runs specialized sub-agents concurrently, followed by review and synthesis.
  
  stages:
    - stage_a_research_analysis
    - stage_b_design_development
    - stage_c_specification_documentation
  
  concurrency:
    max_parallel_agents: 3
    timeout_per_agent: 30_seconds
    retry_on_failure: 2_attempts
    continue_with_partial: true
  
  execution_pattern: |
    For each stage:
    1. Launch parallel agents simultaneously
    2. Collect outputs as agents complete
    3. Review phase - reconcile and validate
    4. Synthesis phase - create integrated artifacts
    5. Main agent QA - final validation
    6. Approval gate - user confirms before next stage

      - Use artifact references instead of full content
      - Progressive synthesis instead of monolithic assembly
      - Stage-based approval gates prevent runaway generation
