# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# PARALLEL EXECUTION ARCHITECTURE
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
parallel_execution:
  overview: |
    To prevent token limit exhaustion, the workflow is decomposed into 3 parallel stages.
    Each stage runs specialized sub-agents concurrently, followed by review and synthesis.
  
  stages:
    - stage_a_research_analysis
    - stage_b_design_development
    - stage_c_specification_documentation
  
  concurrency:
    max_parallel_agents: 3
    timeout_per_agent: 30_seconds
    retry_on_failure: 2_attempts
    continue_with_partial: true
  
  execution_pattern: |
    For each stage:
    1. Launch parallel agents simultaneously
    2. Collect outputs as agents complete
    3. Review phase - reconcile and validate
    4. Synthesis phase - create integrated artifacts
    5. Main agent QA - final validation
    6. Approval gate - user confirms before next stage

    confirmation_message: |
      UX Design Documentation created via parallel sub-agent orchestration.
      Stages: {stage_count} | Agents: {agent_count} | Flowcharts: {flowchart_count}
      Quality: Research {stage_a_score}, Design {stage_b_score}, Docs {stage_c_score}
      Style: Flowchart-heavy, minimal prose, maximum density
  
  phase_9_refinement:
    action: Offer refinement options after delivery
    options:
      - adjust_tone (modify writing style)
      - expand_section (add more detail to specific sections)
      - condense_section (reduce detail in specific sections)
      - add_examples (include more concrete examples)
      - adjust_flowcharts (modify or add flowchart visualizations)
      - realign_to_reference (better match reference document style)
      - re_execute_stage (re-run specific stage with adjustments)

      additions:
        - discovery_phase
        - incremental_execution
        - detailed_logging
        - checkpoint_saves
  
  token_management:
    monitoring:
      - Track token usage per agent
      - Monitor total context size
      - Alert at 80% token limit
      - Trigger fallback at 90%
    
    optimization_strategies:
      - Distribute processing across agents
      - Limit context shared between stages
      - Use artifact references instead of full content
      - Progressive synthesis instead of monolithic assembly
      - Stage-based approval gates prevent runaway generation
    
    fallback_modes:
      token_limit_warning:
        action: Enable aggressive summarization
        threshold: 80_percent
      
      token_limit_critical:
        action: Switch to sequential_execution
        threshold: 90_percent
        note: Reduces concurrency to 1, processes agents sequentially
  
  failure_handling:
    agent_failure:
      retry_attempts: 2
      fallback: Continue with partial results
      escalation: Request manual input for failed component
    
    stage_failure:
      retry_attempts: 1
      fallback: Switch to sequential mode for this stage
      escalation: Present issue to user, offer alternative approach
    
    parallel_execution_failure:
      action: Fall back to sequential execution for remaining stages
      notification: Inform user of execution mode change
      note: Quality maintained, only execution strategy changes
